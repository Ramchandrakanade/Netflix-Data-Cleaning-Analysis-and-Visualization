# Netflix Content Analysis Using Python

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform. The dataset includes movies and TV shows with attributes such as title, type, release year, genre, duration, and more.

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand content distribution.
- Visualize key insights using charts and graphs.
- Generate a word cloud of popular movie titles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows).
- Trends in content release over the years.
- Popular genres and durations.
- Word cloud visualization of movie titles.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is `netflix_titles.csv`, which contains information on Netflix's available titles as of a specific point in time.



## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open `Data.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to see the analysis and visualizations.

## 📬 Conclusion
This project provides a basic but insightful look at Netflix's content using Python data analysis techniques. It can be extended to include recommendations, sentiment analysis, or integration with streaming APIs.
